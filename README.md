Weather App – HTML, CSS, JavaScript & API Integration

The Weather App is a fully responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide real-time weather information for any city worldwide. The app connects to a public Weather API to fetch live data, including:

Current Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit

Weather Conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)

Humidity Levels (%)

Wind Speed (km/h or mph)

Dynamic Weather Icons matching the conditions

Key Features:

Search Functionality – Users can enter any city name to get instant weather updates.

Real-Time Data – Information is fetched directly from the API and updates dynamically without page reload.

Responsive Design – Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

User-Friendly Interface – Clean, minimal design for an easy and engaging user experience.

Error Handling – Displays user-friendly messages for invalid city names or API errors.

Technology Stack:

HTML5 – Structure and content layout

CSS3 – Styling, responsive layout, and animations

JavaScript (ES6) – Fetch API requests, DOM manipulation, and event handling

OpenWeatherMap API (or similar) – Source of weather data

This project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous JavaScript programming, and responsive web design skills, making it a practical and visually appealing weather solution.
